23600,6,3,5,9850,3,90,one integer,2242.0,"Moe stole $3540. 

First, calculate the total amount invested by Emily before Uni stole 5%: $23600 / (1 - 0.05) = $23600 / 0.95 = $24842.11

Let x be the amount Moe stole. Since Moe stole 90% more than Uni, we can write the equation x = 1.9 * 0.05 * $24842.11

Solve for x:","Emily invested $23600 in two different accounts and has a cat named Uni.
